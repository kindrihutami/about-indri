Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khoriah Indrihutami.

I hold a Medical Doctor (MD) degree from the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia.

Prior to pursuing the MSc in International Health and Tropical Medicine, I worked at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Indonesia (OUCRU Indonesia) as a Research Physician in a phase II whole sporozoite malaria vaccine trial from which I published an article of the trialâ€™s implementation.

Shortly after, I shifted role to Clinical Research Coordinator for a COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness study in collaboration with Universitas Gadjah Mada and the US CDC where I managed all of the research activities, from protocol development to data analysis. Additionally, I managed and oversee the clinical safety in all of the ongoing clinical trials within OUCRU Indonesia. In 2023, I was awarded the Indonesian Endowment Fund scholarship to pursue a masterâ€™s degree.

My research interests include sexual and reproductive health, period poverty, WASH, and infectious diseases of poverty.

I love 80s music ðŸŽµ and trying out new foods.
